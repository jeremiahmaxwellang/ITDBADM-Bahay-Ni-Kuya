### üõ†Ô∏è Issue: Cannot Delete Database in phpMyAdmin (XAMPP) ‚Äî "Directory Not Empty"

If you're using XAMPP and encounter the error **"Cannot delete database, directory not empty"** in phpMyAdmin, this guide will help you resolve it safely.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem

When attempting to delete a database via phpMyAdmin, you may see:
```Cannot delete database: Directory not empty```


This typically occurs when MySQL cannot remove the database folder from the file system due to leftover files or locked resources.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Steps

### 0. Try dropping the Database first

On the SQL tab in myphpadmin, use the following SQL statement:
```  DROP SCHEMA bahaynikuya_db;  ```

## If Schema is not dropping:

### 1. Stop MySQL Service

Before making any changes:

- Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
- Click **Stop** next to **MySQL**

This ensures no files are in use or locked.

---

### 2. Locate the MySQL Data Directory

Navigate to the MySQL data folder:

```C:\xampp\mysql\data\```


Find the folder named after your database (e.g., `bahaynikuya_db`).

---

### 3. Delete the Database Folder Manually

- Right-click the folder (e.g., `bahaynikuya_db`)
- Select **Delete**
- If Windows prevents deletion, restart your computer or confirm MySQL is fully stopped

---

### 4. Restart MySQL

- Return to **XAMPP Control Panel**
- Click **Start** next to **MySQL**

Your database should now be removed from phpMyAdmin.

---

## üßπ Optional Cleanup

If the folder contains leftover files like:

- `table_name.frm`
- `table_name.ibd`
- `db.opt`

### 5. Run the DB Scripts

- In the myphpadmin SQL menu, copy paste and run the following scripts:
- bnk-schema.sql
- procedures.sql
- triggers.sql

Your database should now be removed from phpMyAdmin.
